            Abhaneri, located at a distance of 95 km from Jaipur on Jaipur-Agra Road, is a village in the Dausa district of Rajasthan. The place is widely popular as it is home to a colossal stepwell, Chand Baori, which is considered among the most beautiful stepwells of India. The village of Abhaneri is believed to have been established by Samrat Mihir Bhoj who was a Gurjar Pratihar king. The village was originally named Abha Nagri, which means the “city of brightness”; however, with time, due to mispronunciation of the term, it has changed to Abhaneri.
